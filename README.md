# WinUI3Preview4_Problems_DataGrid

This repository contains two solutions with sample code demonstrating the DataGrid in both UWP and WinUI3 Preview4 Desktop.

The UWP sample code works as expected. However, the WinUI3 Desktop sample code crashes when the DataGrid is loaded. The application window appears and soon after the application breaks. 

Previously in Preview 3, the DataGrid would crash when it was resized to have a scrollbar or has enough data to require the window to have a scrollbar.
